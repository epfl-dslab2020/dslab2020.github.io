## Description

This hands-on course teaches the tools & methods used by data scientists, from researching solutions to scaling up prototypes to Spark clusters. It exposes the students to the entire data science pipeline, from data acquisition to extracting valuable insights applied to real-world problems.

Students work in groups of 4 on big data science problems of the kind typically faced in the industry. There are four graded homeworks and a final project with a video presentation.

## Questions

Questions and discussions about the course are gathered on Slack: [https://epfl-dslab2020.slack.com](https://epfl-dslab2020.slack.com). You will receive an invitation to join the workspace.
